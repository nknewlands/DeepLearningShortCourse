Tutorial on CNN and RNN for proteic sequences analysis
======================================================

This directory includes files for the *Practical examples - Translation RNN and time-series anomaly detection.*

This tutorial is in two parts.

File *dpsites.py* describe a 1D CNN used to detect cleavage site in proteic sequences.

File *dpsites_GRU.py* describe the use of a GRU to accomplish the same task, but with better accuracy.
