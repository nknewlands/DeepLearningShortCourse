Tutorial on CNN
===============
This directory includes files for the *Practical examples - Classification of images (CNN): fruit and landcover/landuse satellite remote-sensing imagery*

This tutorial is in two parts.

Part 1 is a basic CNN for the classification of oranges and pineapple. Part 2 is on the use of pre-trained networks such as MobileNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381). See https://keras.io/applications/#documentation-for-individual-models
