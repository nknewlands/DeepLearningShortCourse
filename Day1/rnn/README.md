Demonstration of Recurent Neural Network with Keras
===================================================

This illustrate the basic units of a recurent neural network (Gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer (Chung et al. in 2014)) 
and the visualization using Google Tensorboard (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard). 

It also demonstrate the concepts of Dropout, Stacking recurent layer and some validation.

*Note*: you need to unzip the **jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip** before using the RNNexample.R file.

Part of the code is from: Fran√ßois Chollet with J. J. Allaire, Deep Learning with R." Manning (2018) 360 pages.
