Tutorial : EuroSat classification using transfer learning 
=========================================================

This tutorial illustrate the training of a CNN using transfer learning.

Part 1. Is the training of the CNN (train_resnet_rgb.py)

Part 2. Demonstrate how to use a trained model (test_resnet_rgb.py)

The sample_data directory contains simple land use classification results.
